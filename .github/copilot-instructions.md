## Quick context — what this repo is

- This is an Xcode Swift app named "DashLink HUD" (project file: `DashLink HUD2.0.xcodeproj`).
- Single primary target: `DashLink HUD` (product: `DashLink HUD.app`).
- Swift version: 5.0. Project uses generated Info.plist entries and asset catalogs (AppIcon, AccentColor).

## High-level architecture (what to know first)

- Folder / group layout mirrors app responsibilities:
  - `Service/` — stores and data providers (e.g. `SettingsStore.swift`, `HistoryStore.swift`, `MockDataService.swift`).
  - `View/` — SwiftUI / UI views (e.g. `HUDView.swift`, `TopBarView.swift`, `TileView.swift`, `DetailDrawerView.swift`).
  - `Data/` — app data files; the project has a file-system-synchronized group with exceptions for some files (see `project.pbxproj` "Exceptions for \"Data\" folder").

- Typical data flow: Services/Stores provide model/state (Settings/History/MockData) consumed by Views. When you change a store, trace what Views reference it (examples: `HUDView.swift` reads from stores in `Service/`).

## Important files to reference

- `project.pbxproj` — canonical metadata (targets, build settings, bundle id `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, Swift version, architectures, build configurations). Example: product bundle id is `Doofy-Ltd.DashLink-HUD`.
- `Service/SettingsStore.swift` and `Service/HistoryStore.swift` — primary state hubs; update these when adding app-level state.
- `View/HUDView.swift`, `View/TopBarView.swift` — primary UI entry points; follow these for view composition patterns.
- `Theme.swift` — app-level styling conventions.

## Conventions and small gotchas (project-specific)

- Groups map to on-disk folders (Service, View, Data). Keep new source files in the same group/folder for consistency.
- Info.plist is generated by the project (see `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES` in `project.pbxproj`), so avoid duplicating an on-disk Info.plist unless you intentionally override the generated settings.
- Debug build uses `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH = YES` and `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = -Onone` — expect faster simulator builds during development. Release uses whole-module optimization.
- The project lists supported platforms beyond iOS (macOS/xros), so be careful changing platform-specific code. Use Swift conditional compilation blocks for platform-specific code (wrap code in platform checks).
- Prefer small, atomic PRs: UI-only changes in `View/`, state changes in `Service/`, data/model changes under `Data/`.

## Build / run / debug commands (concrete)

- Recommended (interactive): open the workspace/project in Xcode and run the `DashLink HUD` scheme.

- From terminal (non-interactive), you can build the project with xcodebuild. Example (adjust simulator/device as needed):

  xcodebuild -project "/Users/jamesmellish/Downloads/DashLink HUD/DashLink HUD/DashLink HUD2.0.xcodeproj" -target "DashLink HUD" -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14' build

- To produce an archive (Release) via terminal, use the `-configuration Release` and appropriate CODE_SIGN settings.

## Editing guidance for AI agents

- When changing state or API shapes, update `Service/*Store.swift` first and then search Views for usages (they live under `View/`). Example: changing SettingsStore keys likely affects `HUDView.swift` and `TopBarView.swift`.
- Prefer small, atomic PRs: UI-only changes in `View/`, state changes in `Service/`, data/model changes under `Data/`.
- If adding new resource files under `Data/`, double-check the exceptions block in `project.pbxproj` (there is an explicit exception set for the `Data` folder). This project uses filesystem-synchronized groups — don't rely solely on Xcode's GUI to add files; prefer adding them to the folder and committing changes to the project file if necessary.

## Tests and CI

- This repository currently does not expose an in-repo XCTest target (no test files discovered). If you add tests:
  - Create an Xcode test target and follow the same target name pattern (`DashLink HUD Tests`).
  - Use `xcodebuild test -project <...> -scheme "DashLink HUD" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'` to run tests in CI.

## Integration points / external deps

- No Swift Package Manager manifest or CocoaPods detected in the project root — dependencies (if any) appear to be managed directly in the Xcode project.
- Asset catalogs and generated localized strings are used (`ASSETCATALOG_*`, `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS`). Keep assets under the Xcode asset catalogs.

## Short examples the agent can use

- To find where settings are used:
  - Search for `SettingsStore` and then update dependent views in `View/`.
- To change the bundle id or product name: edit `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` or use Xcode target settings (see `project.pbxproj` entries).

## If you are unsure / missing info

- If you need test schemes or CI commands, tell me which CI provider you want and I will scaffold `xcodebuild`-based steps.
- If you'd like me to add a minimal XCTest target and a smoke test that the app builds, say so and I'll add it.

Please review these notes and tell me which areas you want expanded (CI workflows, test scaffolding, or more examples mapping functions to files). I'll iterate based on your feedback.
